# Project Inspiration

## Trends

- Minimalist layouts with strong visual hierarchy
  Clean compositions, generous whitespace, and clear typographic structure to allow projects to stand out without visual noise.

- Editorial typography and expressive type systems
  Use of bold, editorial-style typefaces as a central design element, creating personality while maintaining readability.

- Subtle motion and scroll-based interactions
  Purposeful animations, parallax effects, and smooth transitions that enhance the experience without overwhelming the content.

  I also created a initial wireframe in figma to base the design of my webpage out of. Some changes were made in the final result of the web, but the color scheme, typography and overall style of the design remained.

## Theme Draft

The core concept of this project is to create a flexible creative portfolio template that balances strong visual identity with usability and clarity.  
Built on a structured wireframe, the design prioritizes showcasing creative work through clean layouts, editorial typography, and intentional motion. The template is designed to be adaptable, allowing other creatives to personalize it while maintaining a professional, contemporary aesthetic.
