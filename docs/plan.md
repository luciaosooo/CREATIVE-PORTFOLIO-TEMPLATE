# Project Plan & Development Process

## 1. Project Intent & Initial Plan

The goal of this project was to design and develop a creative portfolio website template that could be used both as a personal portfolio and as a reusable base for other creatives. From the beginning, the project was thought as not only a visual showcase, but as a structured, accessible, and adaptable web template suitable for graphic designers and multimedia artists.

The initial plan focused on creating a clean, minimalist layout that would prioritize visual content while maintaining strong usability and responsiveness. The project was also intended to develop practices like: semantic HTML, responsive design, accessibility considerations, and clear documentation.

==========================

## 2. Development Strategy

The development process followed a progressive and structured approach:

- HTML first: The project began with semantic HTML to define the structure, content hierarchy, and accessibility foundations.
- CSS styling: Styles were built using a mobile-first approach, CSS variables for consistency, and CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout. Animations and transitions were added gradually to enhance the user experience without overwhelming the content.
- JavaScript enhancements: Vanilla JavaScript was used to implement interactivity such as project filtering, scroll-triggered animations using the Intersection Observer API, and navigation enhancements.

Throughout development, responsiveness and accessibility were treated as core requirements rather than optional features. The site was tested across different screen sizes to ensure readability, touch-friendly interactions, and consistent behavior.

==========================

## 3. Use of AI Tools

Generative AI tools were used as support tools, not as substitutes for understanding or decision-making.

- ChatGPT was used primarily to generate placeholder or filler text and to help draft documentation content.
- Claude was used during debugging and when implementing specific JavaScript functionality. In these cases, it was asked to explain how certain features could be implemented, especially when dealing with concepts that were unfamiliar at the time.
- GitHub Copilot (VS Code) was used for code suggestions and autocompletion, mainly to speed up repetitive tasks.

In all cases, AI-generated suggestions were only incorporated after being fully understood. Any code or solution was reviewed, adapted, and only used if I was confident that I could recreate it independently. AI was treated as a learning and productivity aid, while most technical decisions and implementations were guided by course notes and previously learned concepts, particularly for animations and layout techniques.

==========================

## 4. Key Decisions & Changes

A key decision was to build the project as a reusable template rather than a single-purpose personal portfolio. This influenced choices such as content structure, documentation, and customization flexibility.

Another important choice was to rely on vanilla JavaScript instead of external frameworks, in order to maintain control over functionality and better demonstrate fundamental front-end skills. Visual effects and animations were intentionally kept subtle to balance aesthetics, performance, and accessibility.

Some design and interaction details evolved during development as usability testing highlighted opportunities for improvement, especially in navigation clarity and project presentation.

==========================

## 5. Final Reflection

This project successfully combines design and development, reinforcing best practices in semantic HTML, responsive design, accessibility, and interaction design. The process highlighted the importance of planning, testing, and iteration, particularly when working on a reusable template.

If extended further, the project could include theme variations, dark and light mode, additional customization options, or multilingual support. Overall, this project reflects both technical growth and a deeper understanding of how design and development decisions impact user experience.
